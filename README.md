The purpose of this project is to build a React-based weather application that allows users to:

Search for weather information by city name

View the current temperature and weather conditions

Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units

Receive clear error messages when a city is not found

The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather data and demonstrates key React concepts like component-based design, context for state management, and environment variables for API key security. It also incorporates Bootstrap for UI styling. This project is designed as a learning tool to practice modern React development, API integration, and responsive user interfaces.
